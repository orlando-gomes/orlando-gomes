Programming gives us the opportunity to solve problems and positively impact lives. I develop JavaScript / TypeScript solutions, building web apps with React, and mobile apps with React-Native. I also develop RESTful APIs using NodeJS.

As a programmer, my concern, is writing readable and scalable codes.
